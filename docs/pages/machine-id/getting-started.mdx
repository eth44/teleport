title: Machine ID Getting Started Guide
description: Getting started with Teleport Machine ID
---

# Getting Started

In this getting started guide, you will use Machine ID to create a bot user for
a machine and use that identity to connect to said machine.

Here's an overview of what you will do:

1. Download and install Teleport (=teleport.version=)
2. Create bot user
3. Start Machine ID
4. Use Machine ID

## Prerequisites

Before using Machine ID, you will need an existing Teleport cluster.

If you have not setup a Teleport cluster before, follow the
[Getting started](https://goteleport.com/docs/getting-started) to setup a
Teleport cluster.

## Step 1/4. Download and install Teleport (=teleport.version=)

In this step, you will be downloading and installing Teleport binaries onto the
machine you wish to assign an identity to. Teleport packages hosted on our
downloads page ships with several useful binaries. The most important one for
Machine ID is `tbot`.

Machine ID is available starting from the Teleport `9.0.0` release. Download
the appropriate Teleport package for your platform from our
[downloads page](https://goteleport.com/teleport/download).

## Step 2/4. Create bot user

Before you create a bot user, you need to determine which role(s) you want to
assign to it. You can use the `tctl` command below to examine what roles exist
on your system.

<Details scope={["cloud"]} scopeOnly={true}>
On your client machine, login to Teleport using `tsh` then `tctl` to examine
what roles exist on your system.
</Details>
<Details scope={["oss","enterprise"]} scopeOnly={true}>
Connect to Teleport Auth Server and use `tctl` to examine what roles exist on
your system.
</Details>

```code
$ tctl get roles --format=text
```

You will see something like below on a fresh install of Teleport with the
default roles -- your cluster may have different roles. In this example, let's
assume you want to give the bot the `access` role to allow it to connect to
machines within your cluster.

```
Role    Allowed to login as                           Node Labels Access to resources
------- --------------------------------------------- ----------- ----------------------------------------

editor                                                            user:list,create,read,update,delete,...
```


You can join with a token or [IAM Method](https://goteleport.com/docs/setup/guides/joining-nodes-aws) on AWS.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Token-based Joining">
  ```code
  $ tctl bots add robot --roles=access
  ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="IAM Method">
  If you are running Machine ID on AWS, you can use the IAM method when creating a bot user.

  First, create a token the IAM method token that will specify the AWS account
  from which the bot can join from.

  ```
  kind: token
  version: v2
  metadata:
    # The token name is not a secret because instances must prove that they are
    # running in your AWS account to use this token.
    name: iam-token
    # Set a long expiry time, the default for tokens is only 30 minutes.
    expires: "3000-01-01T00:00:00Z"
  spec:
    # Only allow bots to join using this token.
    roles: [Bot]
  
    # Set the join method to be IAM.
    join_method: iam

    # Define the name of the bot that will be allowed to use this token. Note,
    # the "bot-" prefix is required, the name of the bot is simply "robot".
    bot_name: bot-robot
  
    allow:
    # Restrict the AWS account and (optionally) ARN that can use this token.
    # This information can be obtained from running the
    # "aws sts get-caller-identity".
    - aws_account: "111111111111"
      aws_arn: "arn:aws:sts::111111111111:assumed-role/teleport-bot-role/i-*"
  ```

  Next, create the bot user.

  ```
  $ tctl bots add robot --token=iam-token --roles=access
  ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Step 3/4. Start Machine ID

Now start Machine ID using the `tbot` binary. The `tbot start` command will
start running Machine ID in a loop writing renewable certificates to
`/var/lib/teleport` and the short lived certificates your application will use
to `/opt/machine-id`.

In a production environment you will want to run Machine ID in the background
using a service manager like systemd. However, in this guide you will run it in
the foreground to better understand how it works.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Token-based Joining">
  ```code
  $ tbot start \
     --data-dir=/var/lib/teleport
     --destination-dir=/opt/machine-id \
     --token=00000000000000000000000000000000 \
     --join-method=token \
     --ca-pin=sha256:1111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111 \
     --auth-server=auth.example.com:3025
  ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="IAM Method">
  ```code
  $ tbot start \
     --data-dir=/var/lib/teleport
     --destination-dir=/opt/machine-id \
     --token=iam-token \
     --join-method=iam \
     --ca-pin=sha256:1111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111 \
     --auth-server=auth.example.com:3025
  ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Replace the following fields with values from your own cluster.

* `token` is the token output by `tctl bots add` command or the name of your
IAM method token
* `ca-pin` is the CA Pin for your Teleport cluster output by the `tctl bots add`
command
* `destination-dir` is where Machine ID writes the renewable certificates to.
This certificate is only used by Machine ID and should not be exposed to tools.
* `data-dir` is where Machine ID writes the short lived certificate to. This
certificate can be used by applications and tools.
<Details scope={["cloud"]} scopeOnly={true}>
* `auth-server`: Replace this with the address of your Teleport Auth Server.
</Details>
<Details scope={["oss","enterprise"]} scopeOnly={true}>
* `auth-server`: Replace this with the address of your Teleport Cloud Proxy Server.
</Details>

Once Machine ID is successfully started, let's investigate the `/opt/machine-id`
directory to see what was written to disk.

```
$ tree /opt/machine-id
machine-id
├── key
├── key.pub
├── known_hosts
├── ssh_config
├── sshcacerts
├── sshcert
├── tlscacerts
└── tlscert

0 directories, 8 files
```

This directory contains private key material, SSH certificates, X.509
certificates, and OpenSSH configuration to make it easy to integrate Machine
ID with external tooling.

## Step 4/4. Use Machine ID

To use Machine ID, find a host that is registered within your cluster to
connect to using `tsh ls`. You might see output like the following on your own
system.

```code
$ tsh ls
Node Name Address        Labels                        
--------- -------------- ----------------------------- 
node-name  127.0.0.1:3022 arch=x86_64,group=api-servers 
```

To use Machine ID with the OpenSSH integration, simply run the following
command to connect to `node-name`.

```
ssh -F /opt/machine-id/ssh_config root@node-name
```

<Admonition type="note" title="Roles must have logins defined">
  If you see the below error, it means the user you are trying to login as is
  not specified under `logins` in the role you are using. If you have been
  following along with the `access` role, run
  `tctl get roles/access > access.yaml`, update the `logins` field, and update
  your role with `tctl create -f access.yaml`.

  ```code
  $ ssh -F /opt/machine-id/ssh_config root@node-name
  root@node-name: Permission denied (publickey).
  kex_exchange_identification: Connection closed by remote host
  ```
</Admonition>

Now you can replace any invocations of `ssh` with the above command for
automation to use Machine ID.
