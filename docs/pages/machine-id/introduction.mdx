# Machine ID

Machine ID is a fully automated Certificate Authority designed to
programmatically issue and renew short-lived certificates to any service
accounts, with fine-grained role-based access controls and audit built in.

Some of the things you can do with Machine ID:

* Machines can retrieve short-lived certificates for CI/CD pipelines.
* Machines hsort lived certs for db in applications.
* Configure role-based access controls and locking for machines.
* Capture database access events as well as query activity in the audit log.

## Demo

Let's create a bot and use the machine identity to connect to a server.
